Documentation for UVVM
========================================

The documentation for UVVM is organised as follows:

UVVM general introduction and user information
--------------------------------------------------
At this stage given via PowerPoint presentations - as we intend to release videos in the future
This documentation is basically split into the following parts:
1. The_critically_missing_VHDL_TB_feature.ppsx
2. VVC_Framework_Manual.pdf
3. VVC_Implementation_Guide.pdf
4. Common_VVC_Methods.pdf
5. UVVM_Common_Methods_And_Mechanisms.pdf

These documents are located in this directory.


It is recommended that new users read the above documents in the given order - down to the level they need for their use of UVVM.
(Would typically differ in needs in a team of multiple FPGA developers (or verification engineers))


VVC documentation
--------------------------------------------------
General usage and command reception are covered by the UVVM documentation
VVC features, configuration and dedicated methods are covered by VVC Quick references.
The same applies to BFMs.

VVC and BFM Quick References are located in the doc directory for their respective VVCs.
