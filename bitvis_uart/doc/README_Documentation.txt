Information about documentation for UART
===========================================

The documentation for this module is not included - as this module is not a part of the UVVM deliverables.
The design (VHDL source code) and Testbench is delivered with UVVM in order to illustrate the usage and debugging support provided by UVVM.
This is NOT an example of how to implement a UART. This is just a simple test vehicle that can be used to demonstrate the functionality of the UVVM VVC Framework.
